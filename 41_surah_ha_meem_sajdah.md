## [Surah Hamim Sajda (41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Q6E9vXnjk)
* There was a council of 11 people sitting in Kabba
* `Utbah (Chief Spokesman)` came to Prophet PBUH in `Kabba` and offered the following:

####
1. `First Offer`: We'll give you Leadership
2. `Second Offer`: We'll are going to give you priviliges: Money and Women
3. `Third Offer`: Just in case, as peopele or saying, If there is something wrong with your head (Nauz Billah) then we'll get it treated
4. `Fourth Offer`: If there is Jinn on you, then we'll call some Kahan


* Why Prophet PBUH was silent?
    * `Jibrael AS said, "Ya, Rasool Allah, You'll not reply this person, Allah SWT is Angry. He'll reply this"`
